# Algorithms Lab - BTH

This repository contains the examinations from the Algorithms course at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH). The course covers various fundamental topics in algorithms, including searching, finding, data structures, and graph theory.

## Examinations

### Examination 1: Sorting and Finding
In this examination, we focused on searching and sorting algorithms. Key topics included:
- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items, with a time complexity of O(log n).
- **Insertion Sort**: An simple sorting algorithm also it is stable, with a time complexity of O(n^2).

### Examination 2: Data Structures
This examination delved into essential data structures and their time complexities. Topics covered:
- **Linked Lists**: A linear data structure where each element points to the next.
- **Stacks**: A collection of elements with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) access.
- **Priority Queues**: A data structure where each element has a priority, and the element with the highest priority is served before others.
- **Time Complexities**: Analyzing the performance of various data structures and algorithms.

### Examination 3: Graphs and Disjoint Sets
- **Graphs**: Data structures used to represent pairwise relationships between objects.
- **Disjoint Sets**: Also known as Union-Find, a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Algorithms to find the MST, including:
  - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: An algorithm that finds the MST by sorting edges and adding them one by one while avoiding cycles.
  - **Prim's Algorithm**: An algorithm that finds the MST by growing a single tree and adding the cheapest edge from the tree to a new vertex.
## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
- `Lab 1 - Examination A/`: Contains the solutions and relevant files for the first examination.
- `Lab 2 - Examination B/`: Contains the solutions and relevant files for the second examination.
- `Lab 3 - Examination C/`: Contains the solutions and relevant files for the third examination.
